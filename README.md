## About
PlayerStats is a Minecraft server plugin that adds a command to view player statistics in 
top-10 format or individually. Currently tested on all versions between **1.16.5** and **1.21.1** on platforms:
- Bukkit
- Spigot
- Paper
- Purpur

(It's possible PlayerStats works on other platforms too, but these are the ones I have explicitly tested.)

## Features 
* **Easy to use**
  - One central command that can:
    - Explain **how to use** the plugin with `/statistic`
      ![Usage](src/main/resources/images/usage.png)
    - Show you the **top 10** on your server for all possible statistics with `/statistic ... top`
      ![Top_10](src/main/resources/images/top_10.png)
    - See those same statistics for any **individual player** with `/statistic ... player`
      ![Individual_Stat](src/main/resources/images/individual_stat.png)
    - Or look up the **combined total** of everyone on your server
      ![New_Numbers](src/main/resources/images/new_numbers.png)
    - Guide you through the available options while you type with an extensive **tab-complete** feature
      ![Tab_Complete](src/main/resources/images/tab_complete.png)
    - See the output in a **readable format** that makes sense in the Minecraft world, with more information in hover-text:
      ![Damage_Format](src/main/resources/images/damage_format.png)
    - **Share statistics** that you look up with the other players in chat:
      ![Shared_Top_10](src/main/resources/images/shared_top_10.png)


* **No set-up required**
   - PlayerStats will work correctly regardless of how long your server has already existed - it doesn't 
     have to be present when you start a new world
   - Data is retrieved directly from already existing playerfiles, so you don't have to 
     set up a database, use scoreboards, or anything of the sort


* **PlaceholderAPI support**
   - Placeholders are added in a separate expansion, which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Artemis-the-gr8/PlayerStatsExpansion), in the PlaceholderAPI [eCloud](https://api.extendedclip.com/expansions/playerstatsexpansion/), or downloaded in-game with `/papi ecloud download PlayerStats`
   - For more information about the placeholders, see the expansion's [GitHub](https://github.com/Artemis-the-gr8/PlayerStatsExpansion)!


* **Safe**
   - PlayerStats uses **multi-threading** to ensure server performance does not suffer and 
     players cannot crash the server by spamming its commands
   - This also means that calculating statistics will be very **fast**    


* **Customizable**  
    - You can customize the following (and more):
      - Choose which **range of units** you want to display your time-, damage- and distance-based statistics in:
        ![Time_Format](src/main/resources/images/time_format.png)
      - **Automatically translate** statistics to the language of the client that views them, or customize the statistic-names through the **language.yml** file
      - Use festive formatting, or enable rainbow mode whenever!
        ![Translated](src/main/resources/images/translated.png)   
      - Only show statistics for **whitelisted** players
      - Exclude statistics from **banned** players
      - Exclude statistics from specific players with `/statexclude`
      - Limit who is allowed to **share statistics** in chat and how often players can share
      - Limit statistics based on when a player **last joined**.  
        This option can be particularly useful if you have had a lot of players join your server in the past
        whose statistics aren't of particular interest to your current player-base.
        On top of that, limiting the amount of players shown in the top 10 can greatly increase performance speed.
      - The **colors** you want the output to be
      - You can go for default Minecraft chat colors, or use **hex colors**!
      - Whether you want the output to have additional **style**, such as italics 
    - You can configure the following **permissions**:
      - `playerstats.stat` for using the general command (true for everyone by default)
      - `playerstats.share` for sharing statistics in chat (true for everyone by default)
      - `playerstats.reload` for reloading the config (only for OP players by default)
      - `playerstats.exclude` to exclude players from top- and server-statistics (only for OP players by default)

* **Top Command**
  - Quickly view the server's top players for various statistics.
  - Usage: `/top <subcommand> [options]`
  - Available subcommands:
    - `distance_travelled [mode]`: Show top players by distance (`walk`, `sprint`, `crouch`, `air`, `elytra`, `water`, `boat`, `rail`, `minecart`, `horse`, `pig`, `strider`, `climb`, `mount`).
    - `kills [player|hostile|passive]`: Show top player kills or mob kills.
    - `kills entity <type>`: Show top kills of a specific entity (e.g., `zombie`, `creeper`).
    - `ores_mined <ore_type>`: Show top players who mined the specified ore (e.g., `diamond`, `iron`, `ancient_debris`).
    - `mined`: Show top players by total blocks mined.
    - `craft [item]`: Show top players by items crafted, or specify an item (e.g., `stone`).
    - `play_time`: Show top players by total playtime.
  - The plugin provides tab-completion for all subcommands and options.
